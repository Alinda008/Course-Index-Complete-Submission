				 <p1>I choose things around me: dolls, computers and my cat 
					 as my poster themes. During the pandemic, I spent the most 
					 time with them and was very lonely. Whenever I feel lonely, 
					 I feel comfortable looking at the smiling faces of the characters. 
					 My cat sometimes squatts on my computer keyboard to stop me from 
					 studying. Touching its furry head and body makes me feel a little 
					 comforted. The background was painted as a starry sky because before 
					 I came to Canada, my daily routine was changed from morning to night 
					 due to the time difference, which was like a dream. 
					 It also meant that I was studying and attending classes at night. 
					 The smile of the computer was in the hope that I could face life with 
					 a smile in the face of the pandemic. </p1>

				<p2>When I started sketching, my first idea was to draw scenes 
				from places I spend a lot of time at home. Before I came to Toronto, 
				I took some pictures of my desk, and this is a sketch of what the poster 
				I should draw. Stay at home most of the time I was in my class in the middle 
				of the night in the study, alone facing the computer screen, dare not big fear 
				of loud noise home and neighbor rest, recess's favorite anime hand tired look 
				at rear shelves, lu lu lie sleeping in front of the keyboard's soft of cats, 
				feel a trace of happiness, but also spread the lonely... Looking at the smiling 
				faces of the limited edition handwork on the shelf, I envy them for smiling 
				happily all the time... These details of my life come together to form my life 
				under COVID-19.</p2>

	<p>During the first week, I decided to use an excel sheet to draw the poster, so I split the sketch into 3 big pieces: the miku stuffed toy, the computer, and my cat. First, I adjusted the column width and row height of the excel sheet into squares, then mosaicked the photos of the figure and cat I took before, used adobe color to absorb the color, and then copied the color to the excel sheet and filled it according to the rough shape of the draft.</p>
	<p>By the second week, I had no impact when I had the subject drawn. I choose to find some s ongs I like on spotify and put screenshots of the lyrics I like in the poster.</p>

	<p>According to the opinions of the teacher and classmates,
		I tried to change the bow on the Hatsune toy to pink, which is different from the color of the starry sky in the background.
		According to the teacher's suggestion, I chose to translate the Japanese lyrics of the first version into English, and then made a screenshot of the text box in powerpoint and inserted it into the poster</p>
